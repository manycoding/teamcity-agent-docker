Teamcity build agent
========================

This is a teamcity build agent docker image, it uses docker in docker from https://github.com/jpetazzo/dind to allow you to start docker images inside of it :)
When starting the image as a container you must set the TEAMCITY_SERVER environment variable to point to the teamcity server e.g.
```
docker run -e TEAMCITY_SERVER=http://localhost:8111
```

Optionally you can specify your own address using the `TEAMCITY_OWN_ADDRESS` variable.
